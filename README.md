	Halfway to the Future
</h1>

The `2019-design` directory contains two themes for the Halfway to the Future website, the initial design (v1) and then a revamped design (v2). Both were built, designed, and copyrighted by Martin Porcheron. They are themes for [Bolt CMS](http://bolt.cm) and were tested with Bolt CMS 3.6 and 3.7. The Halfway to the Future design and branding was created by Martin Porcheron and is jointly copyrighted Martin Porcheron and the University of Nottingham.
